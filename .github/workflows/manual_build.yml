# Triggers on *manual* release creation only. Automated releases
# handle asset creation in release.yml.
# Github actions do not allow chaining actions triggered via the default
# secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN and instead would require the addition of a personal
# authentication token. See:
# https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#triggering-new-workflows-using-a-personal-access-token
# While we could go this route, it would require the addition of:
# 1) An automated 'bot' account to handle releases from the sanger/qunathub repo
# 2) Users to add the appropriate token to their forks if they want release behaviour.
# Instead I've opted to maintain separate automated and manual release actions.
# The two actions should remain in sync
# Note that upload_url will differ between the two actions.
